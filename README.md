# csharp-console-text-utility-app
A menu-driven C# console application for basic text processing, built to practice control flow, loops, and string operations.
Interactive Text Utility (C# Console App)
Overview

This project is a menu-driven C# console application that performs basic text processing operations such as converting text to uppercase or lowercase and analyzing string length.
The goal of this project is not UI polish, but to practice real programming fundamentals like control flow, loops, user input handling, and string methods.

Features
Interactive console menu
Convert text to: Uppercase, Lowercase
Display character count
Continuous execution using loops
Clean exit option

Concepts Practiced
This project focuses on core C# and programming fundamentals:
Console input/output
do-while loops
if-else statements
switch-case statements

String methods:
ToUpper()
ToLower()
Length

Type conversion
Basic debugging and control flow reasoning
Why both if-else and switch are used
Both conditional approaches are intentionally included to demonstrate understanding of:
When if-else is suitable (logical conditions)
When switch-case is cleaner (menu-based options)
This helps compare readability, structure, and decision-making styles in C#.

How the Program Works
The program displays a menu of options
The user selects an operation
The selected text operation is performed

The program continues running until the user chooses to exit

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Choose an option:
1. Convert text to Uppercase
2. Convert text to Lowercase
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter text: hello world
HELLO WORLD
Text length: 11

Learning Notes
This project was built as part of a learning phase.
Emphasis was placed on reasoning, debugging, and understanding program flow rather than code brevity.
The structure is intentionally simple to allow future refactoring using methods and object-oriented design.

Future Improvements
Refactor repeated logic into methods
Add more text operations (substring, index search)
Apply object-oriented structure
Convert into a larger utility or library
